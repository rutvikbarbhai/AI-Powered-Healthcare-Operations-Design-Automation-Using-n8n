An **AI-driven, event-based healthcare operations workflow** built in **n8n** that automates **insurance verification and pre-authorization** — one of the most manual, delay-prone processes in hospital revenue cycle management.
This system mirrors **real hospital pre-authorization pipelines**, combining scheduling data, insurance eligibility checks, AI-generated clinical justification, automated submissions, status tracking, alerts, and analytics — all orchestrated visually in **n8n**.

## ✨ Problem Statement

In hospitals, insurance pre-authorization for procedures such as **MRIs, CT scans, and surgeries** is one of the most inefficient workflows.
### Observed Issues
- Manual review of upcoming appointments  
- Separate logins for eligibility and payer portals  
- Clinical justification written manually for each request  
- Status tracking via Excel sheets and follow-up calls  
- High denial rates due to missing or weak documentation  
- Staff burnout and delayed patient care  

**Root Cause:**  
Manual effort + fragmented systems + no intelligence layer

##  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3a7713c-0fa3-4fba-a8b3-1cb60e4dafce"  height="25px" style="position: bottom;"> Objective
To design an **autonomous, safe, and auditable workflow** that:

- Reacts to scheduled clinical events  
- Applies insurance logic automatically  
- Uses AI to generate medical justifications  
- Reduces human involvement to **exceptions only**  
- Produces analytics for **operational insight**

## 🏥 What This System Automatically Does ?

- Runs every **15 minutes**
- Fetches **upcoming scheduled procedures**
- Extracts **patient, insurance, and procedure details**
- Checks **insurance eligibility** in real time
- Determines whether **pre-authorization is required**
- Uses **AI to generate structured pre-auth requests**
- Submits requests to **insurance portals**
- Tracks **approval / denial status**
- Alerts staff **only when action is needed**
- Sends **patient notifications**
- Calculates and stores **operational analytics**


## 🔁 End-to-End Workflow (As Built)

This workflow executes a **complete insurance pre-authorization lifecycle**:
```bash
Schedule → Verify → Decide → Generate → Submit → Track → Notify → Analyze
```

- Assisting with **clinical text generation** for insurance pre-authorization requests  
- Helping structure **medical necessity justifications** and urgency classifications  
- Validating **workflow logic**, edge cases, and safety constraints  
- Improving documentation clarity and technical articulation  

All **core system design and implementation decisions**, including:

- Workflow architecture  
- n8n node selection and sequencing  
- Business logic and routing rules  
- Integration strategy (EHR, insurance, database, alerts)  
- Error handling and human-in-the-loop safeguards  

were **designed, implemented, and configured manually** using n8n.

AI was used to **augment reasoning and productivity**, not to autonomously design, deploy, or operate the system.
